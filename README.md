# Object-Avoidance-Car using Arduino Mega 2560

## **1. Introduction**

This project involves the development of an autonomous robot car that can detect and avoid obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor. The robot is driven by two DC motors controlled via an L298N motor driver, with an Arduino Mega serving as the control unit.
